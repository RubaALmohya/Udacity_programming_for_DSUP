<h2> Project 2 </h2>
Explore US Bikeshare System

<h3> Description </h3>
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to 
1. import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
2. write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

=======
Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time
#4 User info
