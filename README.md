<h2> Project 2 </h2>
Explore US Bikeshare System

<h3> Description </h3>
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to 
1. import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
2. write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

<h3>#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)</h3>

>most common month
>most common day of week
>most common hour of day

<h3>#2 Popular stations and trip</h3>

>most common start station
>most common end station
>most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

<h3>#3 Trip duration</h3>

>total travel time
>average travel time

<h3> #4 User info </h3>

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

Files used
In that project we used 3 csv files:

>washington.csv
>new_york_city.csv
>chicago.csv
